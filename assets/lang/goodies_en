<span class="highlight">What is RSS?</span>
RSS is a technology that is well established on the Internet. Feeds are offered by news sites, blogs etc. and you can then view them on your PC or mobile device and be informed immediately about news. Anonymous. Without registration. 100% data protection. And that's why we offer our content via RSS feed. We are not interested in your e-mail addresses and data. We want to give you our things and at the same time you can keep your privacy at peace.

Here's more information on what a feed is and how it works. I want to make it easy for you to get started:

<span class="highlight">What is a Feed?</span>
A feed is a method of subscribing to automatically updated content from websites. You can receive all new posts directly in your feed reader by subscribing to our RSS feed.

<span class="highlight">Why a Feed?</span>
Using a feed offers the best data protection as you do not disclose any personal data. You can receive the content anonymously and without logging in, which protects your privacy.

<span class="highlight">What will be in the Feed?</span>
In the feed you will find regular updates on new blog posts, broadcast dates, background information on the shows, recommendations and much more.

<span class="highlight">How do I subscribe to the Feed?</span>
Subscribing is simple: install an RSS feed reader of your choice (there are many free options online), add the feed URL and you will receive all updates automatically.

<span class="highlight">Can I use the Feed on my Smartphone?</span>
Absolutely! Most feed readers also have mobile apps that allow you to read the content of the feed conveniently on your smartphone.

<span class="highlight">Is there a specific feed reader you can recommend?</span>
There are many great feed readers out there. There are websites you can use to manage your feeds and, of course, apps. Here's a tip for Android phones. Of course, there are also feed readers for other smartphones. Just look for some information on the internet. Recommendation for Android: Feeder (install via <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">F-Droid</a></span> || <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play">PlayStore</a>)

<span class="highlight">Are there any costs for subscribing to the Feed?</span>
No, subscribing to our RSS feed is completely free. You can enjoy the exclusive content without spending a penny.

We hope that these questions and answers will help you to use the RSS feed. See you there!

Best regards,
