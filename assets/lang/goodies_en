A good choice ðŸ˜€ If you want to dive even deeper, take a behind-the-scenes look, and get more information, you're in the right place. Because for all of you who enjoy my show, I have exclusive content on my blog, completely free and with utmost privacy. After putting some thought into it for a few days, here it is:

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;flex-direction:column;"><a href="https://gothfox.github.io/feed.rss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><button class="button-56" role="button">Subscribe to the RSS Newsfeed Now</button></a><br><a href="https://gothfox.github.io/feed.rss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://gothfox.github.io/feed.rss</a></div>

<span class="highlight">Exclusive Content in the RSS Feed</span>
RSS is a proven technique on the internet. Feeds are offered by news sites, blogs, etc., and you can view them on your PC or mobile device, staying immediately informed about updates. Anonymous. No sign-up required. 100% privacy. That's why I offer my content to you via an RSS feed. I'm not interested in your email addresses and data. I want to share my stuff with you while you keep your privacy intact.

Here's more information on what a feed is and how it works. I want to make it easy for you to get started:

<span class="highlight">What is a Feed?</span>
A feed is a method to automatically subscribe to updated content from websites. In my case, by subscribing to the RSS feed, you can receive all new blog posts directly in your feed reader.

<span class="highlight">Why a Feed?</span>
Using a feed provides the best privacy, as you don't disclose personal data. You can follow the content anonymously and without signing up, protecting your privacy.

<span class="highlight">What will be in the Feed?</span>
In the feed, you'll find regular updates on new blog posts, show schedules, behind-the-scenes information about the shows, recommendations, and much more.

<span class="highlight">How do I subscribe to the Feed?</span>
Subscription is easy: Install an RSS feed reader of your choice (there are many free options online), add the feed URL, and you'll receive all updates automatically.

<span class="highlight">Can I use the Feed on my Smartphone?</span>
Absolutely! Most feed readers also have mobile apps, allowing you to comfortably read my exclusive blog content on your smartphone.

<span class="highlight">Is there a specific feed reader you can recommend?</span>
There are many great feed readers out there. There are websites to manage your feeds and, of course, apps. Since I use Android, I can only provide a recommendation for Android. There are, of course, feed readers for other smartphones. Just look up some information online. My recommendation for Android: Feeder (install via <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">F-Droid</a></span> || <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play">PlayStore</a>)

<span class="highlight">Are there any costs for subscribing to the Feed?</span>
No, the subscription to my RSS feed is completely free. You can enjoy the exclusive content without spending a penny.

I hope these FAQs help you in using my exclusive RSS feed. Enjoy reading!
