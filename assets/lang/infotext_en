<span class="highlight">Radio DJ!</span>
Hey ^.^ I used to be a radio host many years ago at one of the largest German Gothic radio stations. Time has passed, life had other plans for me in the meantime. Now, things have settled down, and I'm back with my own radio show. I love playing by my own rules, so I exclusively stream on Mixcloud. I pay a monthly fee there, which is then distributed as royalties to the featured artists. You can listen to me for free.

<span class="highlight">Every Saturday, 10 PM to midnight (UTC +1)</span>
The show airs weekly, Saturdays, 10 pm to midgnight, UTC +1 (Coordinated Universal Time). To make it easy for you, I've programmed something: Under "Schedule," you can find the time when I go on air. It automatically adjusts to your timezone. You can find the link to the stream and more information in the menu above under "Schedule." The stream is accessible on various devices, and it's a streaming video. After the show, I upload the stream, which is available as audio for later listening.

<span class="highlight">Chat</span>
During the broadcast, there's a chat room that is publicly readable, and you can only write in it if you have a Mixcloud account. If you want to join the chat, get yourself an account on Mixcloud.com. Even in the free basic version of your account, you can enter the chat and participate.
